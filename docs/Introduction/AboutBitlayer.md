Users can engage with it using wallets such as **Metamask, imToken, or other Ethereum-compatible wallets**.

Developers are afforded the ease of migrating smart contracts written in **Solidity, Vyper, or any other language that compiles to EVM bytecode** directly to Bitlayer, using the toolchain you are familiar with: **Ethereum JSON-RPC, Hardhat**, etc.
